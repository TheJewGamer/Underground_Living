# Underground Living
A Minecraft datapack that I created using the Sky-Detection-Datapack from CloudWolfYT (https://github.com/CloudWolfYT/Sky-Detection-Datapack/tree/main). This datapack is supposed to be used when playing an underground only challenge. This datapack will wither players if they are exposed to sunlight and also apply hunger if they are above a certain y level in the overworld. These changes should encourage players to stay under ground or make their main bases in the nether or the end which they normally would not be likely to do. However theses changes do not prevent players from going outside in the overworld.
